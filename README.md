# Lookatit
This is an simple tool for finding your folders or files. 

lets say that you are searching for Steam. After you enter steam as an input, the script will search and find the most relevant files, folders, etc. and give it to you as an output. 

you can adjust and filter the things that the script is searching for like, only folders, only, shortcuts, etc. 

the script will create a "files index" txt file on your desktop for it to run more smoothly and faster. the purpose of this happening is, when you search something, instead of running all the way around your pc, the script first tries to find it inside of that txt file. and that makes the script run faster

this only works on windows 10 and over

Python:	start ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9PJPW5LDXLZ5 (opens microsoft store.)
